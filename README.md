## 📖 About 
As a front-end developer, I create the visual elements and user experience of websites or web applications. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I code and build responsive, cross-browser-compatible interfaces based on design concepts. Collaboration with designers, testing, debugging, and optimization are key aspects of my job.
